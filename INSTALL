System Requirement
=======================

pTrimmer requires the zlib library <http://zlib.net>


The following programs are required:

    GNU make
    C compiler (e.g. gcc, clang or MinGW-w64)


For linux and macOS
=======================

Most of the them come with the zlib library pre-installed, eliminating the need for
additional installation

To build the pTrimmer, 'cd' to pTrimmer directory

    cd pTrimmer
    make

Then there will be an executable file --> pTrimmer
Running pTrimmer directly will output the command-line parameters


For Windows
=======================

Require:
  * gcc (MinGW-w64)
  * zlib

Compiling pTrimmer on Windows may not be a straightforward task, therefore, it is
recommended to directly download the precompiled version.

Of course, if you wish to compile it yourself, you can follow the commands below:
1. install MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org/)
    download the msys2 installer and install it in your windows platform

2. install MinGW-w64 tool-chain and zlib
    open the msys2 terminal and run the following command:
    * pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    * pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib

3. work into the pTrimmer directory and compile it
    cd pTrimmer
    mingw32-make.exe

Then there will be an executable file --> pTrimmer.exe
