System Requirement
=======================

pTrimmer requires the zlib library <http://zlib.net>

The following programs are required:

    GNU make
    C compiler (e.g. gcc or clang)


For linux and macOS
=======================

To build the pTrimmer, 'cd' to pTrimmer directory

    cd ./pTrimmer
    make
    make clean

Then there will be an executable file --> pTrimmer-1.3.X


For Windows
=======================

The static library of zlib has been included in the directory of 'Win32',
so there is no need to install zlib library again.
The compiler of MinGW(gcc) <http://www.mingw.org/> is required to compile the program.   

Windows comamd line (CMD) is required to build and use the program.

    cd .\pTrimmer
    mingw32-make
    mingw32-make clean

Then there will be an executable file --> pTrimmer-1.3.X.exe
