# RELEASE_HISTORY #

===================== Version1.1 =====================

Version: 1.1
Date:    2017-10-07
Author:  xiaolong zhang
Email:   xiaolongzhang2015@163.com
Modify:  index.c/AmpWrite:add necessary field!

===================== Version1.2 =====================

Version: 1.2
Date:    2017-10-07
Author:  xiaolong zhang
Email:   xiaolongzhang2015@163.com
Modify:
    query.h: add READLEN=150
    query.c/PrimQuery: add the condition that not sequenced the reverse primer 
    query.c/PrimTrim: strcpy seq and quality directly from the pstart to the end!

Version: 1.2
Date:    2017-10-14

Email:   xiaolongzhang2015@163.com
Modify:
    fastq.c/FastqInit: the write out mode change to "w", to flush the existed file.

===================== Version1.2.1 =====================

Version: 1.2.1
Date:    2017-11-04
Author:  xiaolong zhang
Email:   xiaolongzhang2015@163.com
Modify:
    query.c/SeqQuery: cutlen = 3 + mis, which is more reasonable and fast than previous!
    Test/PrimMatch-1.2.1.py: modify the rules to equivalent to "SeqQuery rules".

NOTE: we modify the rules of sequence query. Because Assuming that every fastq sequence 
has a primer seq, we will sure that after query for "3+mismatch" bases, there is no 
possibility to find the primer seq anymore!

===================== Version1.2.2 =====================

Version: 1.2.2
Date:    2018-01-17
Author:  xiaolong zhang
Email:   xiaolongzhang2015@163.com
Modify:
    query.c/PrimTrim: The data was copied to read cache directly.

NOTE: The function of strcpy is not safe when the memory of src and dest have overlap!

===================== Version1.3.0 =====================

Version: 1.3.0
Date:    2018-04-11
Author:  xiaolong zhang
Email:   xiaolongzhang2015@163.com
Descrip:
    1. support single-end and paired-end
    2. support detect the maximum read length and quality Phred coding(Phred+33 and Phred+64) automatically
    3. support filtering the trimed sequence by average quality [default:20]
    4. firstly search primer sequence with k-mer(seed and extend). If failed, get the most postential(high score) primer sequence and aligned with dynamic algorithm.
Modify:
    1. fastq.h: adding seqtype(sngle and pair) and quality Phred encoding(Phred+33 and Phred+64)
    2. fastq.c: adding funciton "ReadLenCheck", "PhredCheck", "MeanQuality"
        (1) ReadLenCheck: obtain the maximum read length by sample 1000 reads from fastq file
        (2) PhredCheck: check the qualit coding way, one of Phred+33 and Phred+64, by sample 1000 reads from fastq file.
        (3) MeanQuality: calculate the average quality of sequence after trimming.
    3. query.c: adding function "MaxPrimLen", "HammingMode", "DynamicMode", "GetHit"
        (1) MaxPrimLen: obtain the maximum primer length from the amplicon primer list
        (2) HammingMode: search the primer sequence with kmer(seed and extend) and mismatch check with Hamming mode
        (3) DynamicMode: search the primer sequence with dynamic programing algorithm
        (4) GetHit: get all the postential primer sequence and socred by higher kmer hits for primer sequence 
    4. dynamic.c: search the primer sequence with dynamic programing algorithm
